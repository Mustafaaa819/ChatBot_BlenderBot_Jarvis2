Behind the Code:
BlenderBot is loaded with Hugging Face's Transformers:

model_name = "facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
Input is tokenized and sent to the model for response generation:

inputs = tokenizer([user_input], return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
reply = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
